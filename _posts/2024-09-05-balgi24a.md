title: "$ρ$-GNF: A Copula-based Sensitivity Analysis to Unobserved Confounding Using
  Normalizing Flows"
abstract: We propose a novel sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding in observational
  studies using copulas and normalizing flows. Using the idea of interventional equivalence
  of structural causal models, we develop $\rho$-GNF ($\rho$-graphical normalizing
  flow), where $\rho{\in}[-1,+1]$ is a bounded sensitivity parameter. This parameter
  represents the back-door non-causal association due to unobserved confounding, and
  which is encoded with a Gaussian copula. In other words, the $\rho$-GNF enables
  scholars to estimate the average causal effect (ACE) as a function of $\rho$, while
  accounting for various assumed strengths of the unobserved confounding. The output
  of the $\rho$-GNF is what we denote as the $\rho_{curve}$ that provides the bounds
  for the ACE given an interval of assumed $\rho$ values. In particular, the $\rho_{curve}$
  enables scholars to identify the confounding strength required to nullify the ACE,
  similar to other sensitivity analysis methods (e.g., the E-value). Leveraging on
  experiments from simulated and real-world data, we show the benefits of $\rho$-GNF.
  One benefit is that the $\rho$-GNF uses a Gaussian copula to encode the distribution
  of the unobserved causes, which is commonly used in many applied settings. This
  distributional assumption produces narrower ACE bounds compared to other popular
  sensitivity analysis methods.
