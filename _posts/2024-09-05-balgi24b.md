title: Counterfactually-Equivalent Structural Causal Modelling Using Causal Graphical
  Normalizing Flows
abstract: Recent research has highlighted the properties that deep-learning inspired
  causal models such as Deep-Structural Causal Model (Deep-SCM), Causal Autoregressive
  Flow (CAREFL) and Causal-Graphical Normalizing Flow (c-GNF) should exhibit to guarantee
  observational and interventional distribution equivalence with the true underlying
  causal data generating process (DGP), making them suitable for estimating average
  causal effect (ACE) or conditional ACE (CACE). However, for accurate individual-level
  causal effect (ICE) estimation and personalized treatment/public-policy formulation,
  it is crucial to ensure counterfactual equivalence between these models and the
  DGP. Firstly, we demonstrate that c-GNFs provide counterfactual equivalence under
  certain monotonicity assumption of the DGP, enabling precise ICE estimation and
  personalized treatment/public-policy analysis. Secondly, using this counterfactual
  equivalence of c-GNFs, we perform a counterfactual analysis and personalized public-policy
  analysis of the impact of International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs on child poverty
  using large-scale real-world observational data. Our results indicate a reduction
  in child poverty due to the IMF program at different personalization granularities.
  Our study also performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential threats to the
  unconfoundedness assumption and estimates ACE bounds and the E-value. This illustrates
  the potential of c-GNFs for causal and counterfactual inference in fields such as
  social, natural, and medical sciences.
