title: Estimating Bounds on Causal Effects Considering Unmeasured Common Causes
abstract: Maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) can represent causal relationships in systems
  that include unmeasured common direct causes. Constraint-based causal discovery
  methods are able to find solely the Markov Equivalence Class (MEC) of the causal
  structure given a set of observational data. To bound the total effect estimation
  between a pair of variables, when the MEC of the causal structure is known, the
  causal effect on each member in the MEC are computed, while keeping the minimum
  and maximum values as the lower and upper bounds for the total causal effect. However,
  when the modeling is done using MAGs, i.e., the MEC is encoded as a Partial Ancestral
  Graph (PAG), it is not always possible to find an adjustment set over some pairs
  of variables for the computation of the causal effect by covariance adjustment.
  In such cases, the LV-IDA algorithm returns missing values on the causal effects
  computation for some, and occasionally all, of the MAGs in the PAG. We present an
  extension of the LV-IDA algorithm, which we call the LV-IDA+ algorithm, that can
  compute approximated bounds of causal effects between every pair of the variables
  on a PAG. To achieve this, we propose a way to approximate the causal effect estimations
  when it is not possible to find adjustment sets for some pairs of variables on the
  MAGs in a PAG. We evaluate the performance of LV-IDA+ using simulated data generated
  by a canonical DAGs and compare with the LV-IDA algorithm. The results suggest the
  approximations of causal effects computed by LV-IDA+, are better than the missing
  values (simple NAs) returned by the LV-IDA algorithm, at least for the case of observational
  data generated by a canonical DAGs with latent variables.
