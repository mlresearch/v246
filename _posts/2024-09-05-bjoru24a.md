title: A Divide and Conquer Approach for Solving Structural Causal Models
abstract: Structural causal models permit causal and counterfactual reasoning, and
  can be regarded as an extension of Bayesian networks. The model consists of endogenous
  and exogenous variables, with exogenous variables often being of unknown semantic
  interpretation. Consequently, they are typically non-observable, with the result
  that counterfactual queries may be unidentifiable. In this setting, standard inference
  algorithms for Bayesian networks are insufficient. Recent methods attempt to bound
  unidentifiable queries through imprecise estimation of exogenous probabilities.
  However, these approaches become unfeasible with growing cardinality of the exogenous
  variables. This paper proposes a divide and conquer method that transforms a general
  causal model into a set of models with low-cardinality exogenous variables, for
  which any query can be calculated exactly. Bounds for a query in the original model
  are then efficiently approximated by aggregating the results for the set of smaller
  models. Experimental results demonstrate that these bounds can be computed with
  lower error levels and less resource consumption compared to existing methods.
