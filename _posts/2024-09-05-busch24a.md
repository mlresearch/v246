title: "$Ψ$net: Efficient Causal Modeling at Scale"
abstract: Being a ubiquitous aspect of human cognition, causality has made its way
  into modern-day machine-learning research. Despite its importance in real-world
  applications, contemporary research still struggles with high-dimensional causal
  problems. Leveraging the efficiency of probabilistic circuits, which offer tractable
  computation of marginal probabilities, we introduce $\Psi$net, a probabilistic model
  designed for large-scale causal inference. $\Psi$net is a type of sum-product network
  where layering and the einsum operation allow for efficient parallelization. By
  incorporating interventional data into the learning process, the model can learn
  the effects of interventions and make predictions based on the specific interventional
  setting. Overall, $\Psi$net is a causal probabilistic circuit that efficiently answers
  causal queries in large-scale problems. We present evaluations conducted on both
  synthetic data and a substantial real-world dataset, demonstrating $\Psi$net’s ability
  to capture causal relationships in high-dimensional settings.
