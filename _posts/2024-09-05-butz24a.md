title: Fast Arc-Reversal
abstract: Fast arc-reversal (FAR) is proposed as a new exact inference algorithm in
  discrete Bayesian networks (BNs), merging favourable features of Arc-reversal (AR)
  and Variable elimination (VE). AR constantly maintains a sub-BN structure when rendering
  a variable barren via arc reversals, requiring more computational effort than VE,
  which sacrifices a sub-BN structure by directly eliminating a variable. We formally
  establish that FAR can recover a unique and sound sub-BN structure after consecutive
  variable eliminations. Experimental results on real-world benchmark networks empirically
  show a substantial improvement in the average run-time and variance of FAR compared
  to AR. We also suggest a novel method, called d-contraction, for graphically understanding
  FAR since FAR is not always the same as a sequence of arc reversals.
