title: Learning Staged Trees from Incomplete Data
abstract: Staged trees are probabilistic graphical models capable of representing
  any class of non-symmetric independence via a coloring of their vertices. Several
  structural learning routines have been defined and implemented to learn staged trees
  from data, under the frequentist or Bayesian paradigm. They assume a data set has
  been observed fully and, in practice, observations with missing entries are either
  dropped or imputed before learning the model. Here, we introduce the first algorithms
  for staged trees that handle missingness within the learning of the model. To this
  end, we characterize the likelihood of staged tree models in the presence of missing
  data and discuss pseudo-likelihoods that approximate it.  A structural expectation-maximization
  algorithm estimating the model directly from the full likelihood is also implemented
  and evaluated. A computational experiment showcases the performance of the novel
  learning algorithms, demonstrating that it is feasible to account for different
  missingness patterns when learning staged trees.
