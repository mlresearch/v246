title: 'AutoCD: Automated Machine Learning for Causal Discovery Algorithms'
abstract: This paper studies automated machine learning (AutoML) for causal discovery,
  the process of uncovering cause-and-effect relationships within data. Causal discovery
  is an unsupervised learning problem, as the target (the underlying ground truth
  causal model) is typically unknown. Therefore, the loss functions commonly used
  as an optimisation objective in AutoML systems developed for supervised learning
  problems are not applicable. We propose AutoCD, the first AutoML system utilising
  Bayesian optimisation based on a search space of causal discovery algorithms. In
  designing AutoCD, we study and compare the applicability of two different loss functions
  and post-hoc corrections. Additionally, based on the analysis of the performance
  of AutoCD, we propose an improved version called AutoCD_PC by warm-starting the
  search from the PC algorithm. Results from our experiments on datasets simulated
  from 45 graphical models demonstrate that AutoCD_PC performs better than the baselines
  by ranking the highest (avg. rank 3.69) compared to the best causal tuning baseline
  (avg. rank 5.21) and the best fine-tuned individual algorithm (avg. rank 4.36).
