title: LIMID Quality Control Models for Increasing Failure Rate Processes
abstract: A Limited Memory Influence Diagram (LIMID) model for quality control that
  incorporates variable data on sample means from the output of a production process
  is introduced. The process operates over a finite production horizon and is out-of-control
  when the process mean for the output shifts. The probability such a shift occurs
  in the next time period is dependent on the elapsed time since the most recent process
  repair. A set of control limits that are adapted to the length the process has run
  without repair is selected to minimize quality control costs, and the sampling interval
  and sample size can be adjusted to further reduce costs if these modifications are
  operationally feasible. This is the first application of LIMIDs in a quality control
  model with an increasing rate of failure over time, and that implements variable
  data.
