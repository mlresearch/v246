title: Latent Gaussian Graphical Models with Golazo Penalty
abstract: The existence of latent variables in practical problems is common, for example
  when some variables are difficult or expensive to measure, or simply unknown.  When
  latent variables are unaccounted for, structure learning for Gaussian graphical
  models can be blurred by additional correlation between the observed variables that
  is incurred by the latent variables. A standard approach for this problem is a latent
  version of the graphical lasso that splits the inverse covariance matrix into a
  sparse and a low-rank part that are penalized separately. In this paper we propose
  a generalization of this via the flexible Golazo penalty. This allows us to introduce
  latent versions of for example the adaptive lasso, positive dependence constraints
  or predetermined sparsity patterns, and combinations of those.  We develop an algorithm
  for the latent Gaussian graphical model with the Golazo penalty and demonstrate
  it on simulated and real data.
