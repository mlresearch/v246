title: On the Unlikelihood of D-Separation
abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover a causal graph from data generated by it;
  constraint-based methods do so by searching for d-separating conditioning sets of
  nodes. In this paper, we provide analytic evidence that on large graphs, d-separation
  is a rare phenomenon, even when guaranteed to exist. Our analysis implies poor average-case
  performance of existing constraint-based methods, except on a vanishingly small
  class of extremely sparse graphs. We consider a set $V=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ of nodes,
  and generate a random DAG $G=(V,E)$ where $v_i \rightarrow v_j \in E$ with i.i.d
  probability $p_1$ if $i<j$ and probability $0$ if $i > j$. For any d-separable pair
  of nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$, we provide upper bounds on the probability that a subset
  of $V\backslash\{v_i,v_j\}$ d-separates the pair, under different subset selection
  scenarios; our upper bounds decay exponentially fast to $0$ as $|V| \rightarrow
  \infty$ for any fixed expected density. We then analyze the average-case performance
  of constraint-based methods, including the PC Algorithm, a variant of the SGS Algorithm
  called UniformSGS, and also any constraint-based method limited to small conditioning
  sets (a limitation which holds in most of existing literature). We show that these
  algorithms usually suffer from low precision or exponential running time on all
  but extremely sparse graphs.
