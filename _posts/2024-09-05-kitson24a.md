title: Eliminating Variable Order Instability in Greedy Score-Based Structure Learning
abstract: 'Many Bayesian Network structure learning algorithms are unstable in that
  the learnt graph is sensitive to arbitrary artefacts of the dataset, such as the
  ordering of columns (i.e., variable order). PC-Stable, developed by \cite{colombo2014order},
  attempts to address this issue for the widely-used PC algorithm, prompting researchers
  to use the ‘stable’ version instead. However, this problem seems to have been overlooked
  for score-based algorithms. In this study, we show that some widely-used score-based
  algorithms suffer from the same issue and that PC-Stable, although less sensitive
  than most of the score-based algorithms tested, is not completely stable. We also
  present a solution to score-based greedy hill-climbing that completely eliminates
  this instability, and provide two implementations: the HC-Stable and Tabu-Stable
  algorithms, the latter of which learns more accurate graphs than all the well-known
  algorithms we compared it to.'
