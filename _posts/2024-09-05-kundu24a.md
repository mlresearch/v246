title: Time–Approximation Trade-Offs for Learning Bayesian Networks
abstract: 'Bayesian network structure learning is an NP-hard problem. Furthermore,
  the problem remains hard even for various subclasses of graphs. Motivated by the
  hardness of exact learning, we study approximation algorithms for learning Bayesian
  networks. First, we propose a moderately exponential time algorithm with running
  time $\mathcal{O}(2^{\frac{\ell}{r}n})$ that has an approximation ratio $\frac{\ell}{r}$
  where $n$ is the number of vertices and $\ell$ and $r$ are user-defined parameters
  with $\ell\leq r$. That is, we give time–approximation trade-offs for learning Bayesian
  networks. Second, we present a polynomial time algorithm with an approximation ratio
  $\frac{1}{d}$ to find an optimal graph whose connected components have size at most
  $d$. '
