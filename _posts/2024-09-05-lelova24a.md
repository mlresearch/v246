title: Learning Causal Markov Boundaries with Mixed Observational and Experimental
  Data
abstract: A frequent goal in healthcare is to estimate personalized causal effects
  in order to select the best treatment for a patient from observational or experimental
  (RCT) data (or both), where "best" is defined in terms of maximizing the expectation
  of the desired outcome. The first task in estimating personalized effects is selecting
  the optimal set of personalization covariates (causal feature selection). This set
  of covariates is the Markov Boundary of the outcome in the experimental distribution,
  also known as the Interventional Markov Boundary (IMB), and can be identified from
  RCT data using methods for finding Markov Boundaries. However, most RCT data are
  very limited in sample size and do not work well with these methods. In this work,
  we develop methods that combine limited experimental and large observational data
  to identify the IMB, and improve the estimation of conditional (personalized) causal
  effects. These methods extend recent results (Triantafillou et al., 2021), which
  were limited to discrete data, to mixed data with binary and ordinal outcomes. The
  methods are based on Bayesian regression models. In simulated data, we show that
  our methods identify the correct IMB and improve causal effect estimation.
