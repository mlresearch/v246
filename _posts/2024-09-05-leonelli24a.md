title: Context-Specific Refinements of Bayesian Network Classifiers
abstract: Supervised classification is one of the most ubiquitous tasks in machine
  learning. Generative classifiers based on Bayesian networks are often used because
  of their interpretability and competitive accuracy. The widely used naive and TAN
  classifiers are specific instances of Bayesian network classifiers with a constrained
  underlying graph. This paper introduces novel classes of generative classifiers
  extending TAN and other famous types of Bayesian network classifiers. Our approach
  is based on staged tree models, which extend Bayesian networks by allowing for complex,
  context-specific patterns of dependence. We formally study the relationship between
  our novel classes of classifiers and Bayesian networks. We introduce and implement
  data-driven learning routines for our models and investigate their accuracy in an
  extensive computational study. The study demonstrates that models embedding asymmetric
  information can enhance classification accuracy.
