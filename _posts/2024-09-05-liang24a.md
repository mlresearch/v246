title: Kernel-Based Differentiable Learning of Non-Parametric Directed Acyclic Graphical
  Models
abstract: Causal discovery amounts to learning a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that
  encodes a causal model. This model selection problem can be challenging due to its
  large combinatorial search space, particularly when dealing with non-parametric
  causal models. Recent research has sought to bypass the combinatorial search by
  reformulating causal discovery as a continuous optimization problem, employing constraints
  that ensure the acyclicity of the graph. In non-parametric settings, existing approaches
  typically rely on finite-dimensional approximations of the relationships between
  nodes, resulting in a score-based continuous optimization problem with a smooth
  acyclicity constraint. In this work, we develop an alternative approximation method
  by utilizing reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and applying general sparsity-inducing
  regularization terms based on partial derivatives. Within this framework, we introduce
  an extended RKHS representer theorem. To enforce acyclicity, we advocate the log-determinant
  formulation of the acyclicity constraint and show its stability. Finally, we assess
  the performance of our proposed RKHS-DAGMA procedure through simulations and illustrative
  data analyses.
