title: Cauchy Graphical Models
abstract: A common approach to learning Bayesian networks involves specifying an appropriately
  chosen family of parameterized probability density such as Gaussian. However, the
  distribution of most real-life data is leptokurtic and may not necessarily be best
  described by a Gaussian process. In this work we introduce Cauchy Graphical Models
  (CGM), a class of multivariate Cauchy densities that can be represented as directed
  acyclic graphs with arbitrary network topologies, the edges of which encode linear
  dependencies between random variables. We develop CGLearn, the resultant algorithm
  for learning the structure and Cauchy parameters based on Minimum Dispersion Criterion
  (MDC). Experiments using simulated datasets on benchmark network topologies demonstrate
  the efficacy of our approach when compared to Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM).
