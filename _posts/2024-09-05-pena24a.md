title: Alternative Measures of Direct and Indirect Effects
abstract: There are a number of measures of direct and indirect effects in the literature
  on causality. These are suitable in some cases and unsuitable in others. We describe
  a case where the existing measures are unsuitable and propose new suitable ones.
  We also show that the new measures can partially handle unmeasured treatment-outcome
  confounding, and bound long-term effects by combining experimental and observational
  data. We also introduce the concepts of indirect benefit and harm (i.e., through
  a mediator), and use our new measure to quantify them.
