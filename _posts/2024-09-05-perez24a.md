title: Enhancing Bayesian Networks with Psychometric Models
abstract: Bayesian networks (BNs) are a popular framework in education and other fields.
  In this paper, we consider two-layer BNs, where the first layer consists of hidden
  binary variables that are assumed to be independent of each other, and the second
  layer consists of observed binary variables. The variables in the second layer depend
  on the variables in the first layer. The dependence is characterized by conditional
  probability tables, which represent Noisy-AND models. We refer to this class of
  models as BN2A models. We found that these models are also popular in the psychometric
  community, where they can be found under the name of Cognitive Diagnostic Models
  (CDMs), which are used to classify test takers into some latent classes according
  to the similarity of their responses to test questions. This paper shows the relation
  between some BN2A models and their corresponding CDMs. In particular, we compare
  the performance of these models on large-scale tests conducted in the Czech Republic
  in 2022. The BN2A model with general conditional probability tables produced the
  best absolute fit. However, when we added monotonic constraints to the General model,
  we obtained better predictive results.
