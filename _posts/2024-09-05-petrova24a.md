title: An Adaptive Implicit Hitting Set Algorithm for MAP and MPE Inference
abstract: In this paper, we address the use of the implicit hitting set approach (HS)
  for MAP (Markov Random Fields) and MPE (Bayesian Networks). Since the HS approach
  is quite general and finding the best version is very problem-dependent, here we
  present an adaptive algorithm that learns a reasonably good version for the instance
  being solved. The algorithm, which follows a Multi-armed Bandit structure, explores
  the different alternatives as it iterates and adapts their weights based on their
  performance. The weight is used to decide on the probability of selecting a given
  alternative in the next iteration.
