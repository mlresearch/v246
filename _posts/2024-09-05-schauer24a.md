title: 'Causal Structure Learning With Momentum: Sampling Distributions Over Markov
  Equivalence Classes'
abstract: In the context of inferring a Bayesian network structure (directed acyclic
  graph, DAG for short), we devise a non-reversible continuous time Markov chain,
  the “Causal Zig-Zag sampler”, that targets a probability distribution over classes
  of observationally equivalent (Markov equivalent) DAGs. The classes are represented
  as completed partially directed acyclic graphs (CPDAGs). The non-reversible Markov
  chain relies on the operators used in Chickering’s Greedy Equivalence Search (GES)
  and is endowed with a momentum variable, which improves mixing significantly as
  we show empirically. The possible target distributions include posterior distributions
  based on a prior over DAGs and a Markov equivalent likelihood.  We offer an efficient
  implementation wherein we develop new algorithms for listing, counting, uniformly
  sampling, and applying possible moves of the GES operators, all of which significantly
  improve upon the state-of-the-art run-time.
