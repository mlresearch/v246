title: Identifying Total Causal Effects in Linear Models under Partial Homoscedasticity
abstract: A fundamental challenge of scientific research is inferring causal relations
  based on observed data. One commonly used approach involves utilizing structural
  causal models that postulate noisy functional relations among interacting variables.
  A directed graph naturally represents these models and reflects the underlying causal
  structure. However, classical identifiability results suggest that, without conducting
  additional experiments, this causal graph can only be identified up to a Markov
  equivalence class of indistinguishable models. Recent research has shown that focusing
  on linear relations with equal error variances can enable the identification of
  the causal structure from mere observational data. Nonetheless, practitioners are
  often primarily interested in the effects of specific interventions, rendering the
  complete identification of the causal structure unnecessary. In this work, we investigate
  the extent to which less restrictive assumptions of partial homoscedasticity are
  sufficient for identifying the causal effects of interest. Furthermore, we construct
  mathematically rigorous confidence regions for total causal effects under structure
  uncertainty and explore the performance gain of relying on stricter error assumptions
  in a simulation study.
