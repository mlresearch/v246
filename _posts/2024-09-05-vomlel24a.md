title: 'Uncovering Relationships using Bayesian Networks:  A Case Study on Conspiracy
  Theories'
abstract: Bayesian networks (BNs) represent a probabilistic model that can visualize
  relationships between variables. We apply various BN structure learning algorithms
  to a large dataset from a Czech university entrance exam. This dataset includes
  a test of active, open-minded thinking designed by Jonathan Baron, as well as a
  test of students’ attitudes toward various conspiracies. Using BNs, we were able
  to identify the structure of the conspiracies and their relationships with active
  open-minded thinking. We also compared results of different BN structure learning
  algorithms with results of selected standard data analysis methods.
