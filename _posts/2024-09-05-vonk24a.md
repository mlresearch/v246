title: Balancing Computational Cost and Accuracy in Inference of Continuous Bayesian
  Networks
keywords: Bayesian networks, Decision Diagrams, Knowledge Compilation, Causal Inference,
  Bayesian Network Inference, Discretization
abstract: Bayesian networks allow a parsimonious encoding of joint probability distributions
  via directed acyclic graphs. While discrete Bayesian network inference is well-established,
  conducting inference on continuous Bayesian networks often requires discretization.
  In this paper, continuous Bayesian networks are subjected to various supervised
  and unsupervised discretization methods. Subsequently, the discretized Bayesian
  networks are encoded into decision diagrams, facilitating efficient inference. The
  trade-off between the quality of discretization/inference and the computational
  cost of inference with decision diagrams is explored by contrasting both metrics
  on a Pareto front. Through empirical evaluation across a range of causal and non-causal
  Bayesian networks, we investigate the impact of different discretization methods
  on this trade-off. We corroborate the significantly improved scalability of using
  decision diagrams for inference as opposed to traditional inference methods and
  extend this finding to discretized continuous networks. Coupled with insights on
  the accuracy-compute cost trade-off, we advocate for discretization as a viable
  method for Bayesian network inference on continuous networks.
