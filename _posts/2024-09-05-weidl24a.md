title: Exploring Argument Mining and Bayesian Networks for Assessing Topics for City
  Project Proposals
abstract: 'The digital transformation of cities inspired the city administration of
  Aschaffenburg, Germany, to apply artificial intelligence to reduce the significant
  amount of manual administrative effort needed to evaluate citizens’ ideas for potential
  future projects. This paper introduces a methodology that combines argument mining
  with Bayesian networks to evaluate the relative eligibility of city project proposals.
  The methodology involves two main steps: (1) clustering arguments extracted from
  public information available on the Internet, and (2) assessing and comparing selected
  urban issues, planning topics, and citizens’ ideas that have been widely discussed
  to measure public interest in potential candidate projects. The results of the clustering
  are fed into a Bayesian network, along with scores for several evaluation criteria,
  to generate a relative eligibility score. The framework was applied to three candidate
  projects, resulting in the selection of one of them, while the other two were rejected
  with a given explanation. The latter motivates the decision and provides transparency
  to all parties involved in the decision process. The methodology is applicable to
  other cities after adjustments of criteria.'
