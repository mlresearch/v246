title: Serving MPE Queries on Tensor Networks by Computing Derivatives
abstract: Recently, tensor networks have been proposed as a data structure for weighted
  model counting. Computing a weighted model count is thus reduced to contracting
  a factorized tensor expression. Inference queries on graphical models, especially
  PoE (probability of evidence) queries, can be expressed directly as weighted model
  counting problems. Maximization problems can also be addressed on the same data
  structure, only the standard sum-product semiring has to be replaced by either the
  tropical (max-sum) or the Viterbi (max-product) semiring in the computations, that
  is, the tensor contractions. However, tensor contractions only provide maximal values,
  but MPE (most probable explanation) queries on graphical models do not ask for the
  maximal value, but for a state, or even the states, at which the maximal value is
  attained. In the special case of tropical tensor networks for ground states of spin
  glasses, it has been observed that the ground state can be obtained by computing
  a derivative of the tensor network over the tropical semiring. Here, we generalize
  this observation, provide a generic algorithm for computing the derivatives, and
  prove its correctness.
