title: 'Geometric No-U-Turn Samplers: Concepts and Evaluation'
abstract: We enhance geometric Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, in particular making
  them easier to use by providing better tools for choosing the metric and various
  tuning parameters. We extend the No-U-Turn criterion for automatic choice of integration
  length for Lagrangian Monte Carlo and propose a modification to the computationally
  efficient Monge metric, as well as summarizing several previously proposed metric
  choices. Through extensive experimentation, including synthetic examples and posteriordb
  benchmarks, we demonstrate that Riemannian metrics can outperform Euclidean counterparts,
  particularly in scenarios with high curvature, while highlighting how the optimal
  choice of metric is problem-specific.
