title: Modelling Shared Decision Making Interactions using Influence Diagrams
abstract: Shared Decision Making (SDM) has become a predominant element of patient-centered
  healthcare delivery in recent years. In SDM, multiple agents, including a patient
  and a clinician interact to make a joint decision that is aligned with the patientâ€™s
  preferences. Despite its popularity, previous SDM studies lack structured decision
  modeling approaches applied to this problem. This paper presents Influence Diagram
  (ID) models for SDM agents, and proposes graphical operations for IDs to model the
  interaction between the agents. Using a case study, we demonstrate that widely used
  conceptual models for SDM such as the Three Talk Model are aligned with the proposed
  ID models and operations. The case study also shows that SDM is a cooperative decision
  making setting that is also present in non-clinical domains. The proposed influence
  diagrams and interaction operations enable SDM to be studied based on structured
  and quantitative decision models.
