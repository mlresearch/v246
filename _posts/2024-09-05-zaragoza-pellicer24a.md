title: Multi-objective Counterfactuals in Bayesian Classifiers with Estimation of
  Distribution Algorithms
abstract: Counterfactual explanations are a very popular and effective method to convey
  interpretability in supervised classification models. These explanations answer
  the question of which change is needed in the input data to obtain a desired output.
  Computing good counterfactuals involves achieving some key objectives, such as validity,
  minimality, similarity or plausibility. Our proposal consists of using estimation
  of distribution algorithms for approximating counterfactual explanations within
  Bayesian classifiers. They are experimentally compared with a genetic algorithm,
  both with a single-objective and with a multi-objective formulation. Different types
  of Bayesian classifiers will be evaluated to find the differences in their explanations
  and we will use their results together to provide more accurate explanations. The
  experiments show how estimation of distribution algorithms are faster and achieve
  better results with a single-objective whereas they are competitive in the multi-objective
  version.
