    abstract = {There are a number of measures of direct and indirect effects in the literature on causality. These are suitable in some cases and unsuitable in others. We describe a case where the existing measures are unsuitable and propose new suitable ones. We also show that the new measures can partially handle unmeasured treatment-outcome confounding, and bound long-term effects by combining experimental and observational data. We also introduce the concepts of indirect benefit and harm (i.e., through a mediator), and use our new measure to quantify them.}

    pages = {20-37},
    abstract = {We propose a novel sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding in observational studies using copulas and normalizing flows. Using the idea of interventional equivalence of structural causal models, we develop $\rho$-GNF ($\rho$-graphical normalizing flow), where $\rho{\in}[-1,+1]$ is a bounded sensitivity parameter. This parameter represents the back-door non-causal association due to unobserved confounding, and which is encoded with a Gaussian copula. In other words, the $\rho$-GNF enables scholars to estimate the average causal effect (ACE) as a function of $\rho$, while accounting for various assumed strengths of the unobserved confounding. The output of the $\rho$-GNF is what we denote as the $\rho_{curve}$ that provides the bounds for the ACE given an interval of assumed $\rho$ values. In particular, the $\rho_{curve}$ enables scholars to identify the confounding strength required to nullify the ACE, similar to other sensitivity analysis methods (e.g., the E-value). Leveraging on experiments from simulated and real-world data, we show the benefits of $\rho$-GNF. One benefit is that the $\rho$-GNF uses a Gaussian copula to encode the distribution of the unobserved causes, which is commonly used in many applied settings. This distributional assumption produces narrower ACE bounds compared to other popular sensitivity analysis methods.}

    abstract = {Lifted probabilistic inference exploits symmetries in probabilistic graphical models to allow for tractable probabilistic inference with respect to domain sizes. To exploit symmetries in, e.g., factor graphs, it is crucial to identify commutative factors, i.e., factors having symmetries within themselves due to their arguments being exchangeable. The current state-of-the-art to check whether a factor is commutative with respect to a subset of its arguments iterates over all possible subsets of the factor's arguments, i.e., O($2^n$) iterations for a factor with n arguments in the worst case. In this paper, we efficiently solve the problem of detecting commutative factors in a factor graph. In particular, we introduce the detection of commutative factors (DECOR) algorithm, which allows us to drastically reduce the computational effort for checking whether a factor is commutative in practice. We prove that DECOR efficiently identifies restrictions to drastically reduce the number of required iterations and validate the efficiency of DECOR in our empirical evaluation.}

author = {Cobb, Barry R.},
pages = {57-69},
abstract = {A Limited Memory Influence Diagram (LIMID) model for quality control that incorporates variable data on sample means from the output of a production process is introduced. The process operates over a finite production horizon and is out-of-control when the process mean for the output shifts. The probability such a shift occurs in the next time period is dependent on the elapsed time since the most recent process repair. A set of control limits that are adapted to the length the process has run without repair is selected to minimize quality control costs, and the sampling interval and sample size can be adjusted to further reduce costs if these modifications are operationally feasible. This is the first application of LIMIDs in a quality control model with an increasing rate of failure over time, and that implements variable data.}

In this paper, we provide analytic evidence that on large graphs, d-separation is a rare phenomenon, even when guaranteed to exist. Our analysis implies poor average-case performance of existing constraint-based methods, except on a vanishingly small class of extremely sparse graphs. We consider a set $V=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ of nodes, and generate a random DAG $G=(V,E)$ where $v_i \rightarrow v_j \in E$ with i.i.d probability $p_1$ if $i<j$ and probability $0$ if $i > j$. For any d-separable pair of nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$, we provide upper bounds on the probability that a subset of $V\backslash\{v_i,v_j\}$ d-separates the pair, under different subset selection scenarios; our upper bounds decay exponentially fast to $0$ as $|V| \rightarrow \infty$ for any fixed expected density. We then analyze the average-case performance of constraint-based methods, including the PC Algorithm, a variant of the SGS Algorithm called UniformSGS, and also any constraint-based method limited to small conditioning sets (a limitation which holds in most of existing literature). We show that these algorithms usually suffer from low precision or exponential running time on all but extremely sparse graphs.}

We formally establish that FAR can recover a unique and sound sub-BN structure after consecutive variable eliminations. Experimental results on real-world benchmark networks empirically show a substantial improvement in the average run-time and variance of FAR compared to AR. We also suggest a novel method, called d-contraction, for graphically understanding FAR since FAR is not always the same as a sequence of arc reversals.}

In SDM, multiple agents, including a patient and a clinician interact to make a joint decision that is aligned with the patient’s preferences.

This paper presents Influence Diagram (ID) models for SDM agents, and proposes graphical operations for IDs to model the interaction between the agents. Using a case study, we demonstrate that widely used conceptual models for SDM such as the Three Talk Model are aligned with the proposed ID models and operations. The case study also shows that SDM is a cooperative decision making setting that is also present in non-clinical domains. The proposed influence diagrams and interaction operations enable SDM to be studied based on structured and quantitative decision models.}

PC-Stable, developed by \cite{colombo2014order}, attempts to address this issue for the widely-used PC algorithm, prompting researchers to use the ‘stable’ version instead. However, this problem seems to have been overlooked for score-based algorithms. In this study, we show that some widely-used score-based algorithms suffer from the same issue and that PC-Stable, although less sensitive than most of the score-based algorithms tested, is not completely stable. We also present a solution to score-based greedy hill-climbing that completely eliminates this instability, and provide two implementations: the HC-Stable and Tabu-Stable algorithms, the latter of which learns more accurate graphs than all the well-known algorithms we compared it to.}

    abstract = {Recent research has highlighted the properties that deep-learning inspired causal models such as Deep-Structural Causal Model (Deep-SCM), Causal Autoregressive Flow (CAREFL) and Causal-Graphical Normalizing Flow (c-GNF) should exhibit to guarantee observational and interventional distribution equivalence with the true underlying causal data generating process (DGP), making them suitable for estimating average causal effect (ACE) or conditional ACE (CACE). However, for accurate individual-level causal effect (ICE) estimation and personalized treatment/public-policy formulation, it is crucial to ensure counterfactual equivalence between these models and the DGP. Firstly, we demonstrate that c-GNFs provide counterfactual equivalence under certain monotonicity assumption of the DGP, enabling precise ICE estimation and personalized treatment/public-policy analysis. Secondly, using this counterfactual equivalence of c-GNFs, we perform a counterfactual analysis and personalized public-policy analysis of the impact of International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs on child poverty using large-scale real-world observational data. Our results indicate a reduction in child poverty due to the IMF program at different personalization granularities. Our study also performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential threats to the unconfoundedness assumption and estimates ACE bounds and the E-value. This illustrates the potential of c-GNFs for causal and counterfactual inference in fields such as social, natural, and medical sciences.}

Our approach is based on staged tree models, which extend Bayesian networks by allowing for complex, context-specific patterns of dependence.

We introduce and implement data-driven learning routines for our models and investigate their accuracy in an extensive computational study. The study demonstrates that models embedding asymmetric information can enhance classification accuracy.}

pages = {199-212},
abstract = {The existence of latent variables in practical problems is common, for example when some variables are difficult or expensive to measure, or simply unknown. 
When latent variables are unaccounted for, structure learning for Gaussian graphical models can be blurred by additional correlation between the observed variables that is incurred by the latent variables.
A standard approach for this problem is a latent version of the graphical lasso that splits the inverse covariance matrix into a sparse and a low-rank part that are penalized separately.
In this paper we propose a generalization of this via the flexible Golazo penalty. This allows us to introduce latent versions of for example the adaptive lasso, positive dependence constraints or predetermined sparsity patterns, and combinations of those. 
We develop an algorithm for the latent Gaussian graphical model with the Golazo penalty and demonstrate it on simulated and real data.}

    pages = {213-230},
    abstract = {A fundamental challenge of scientific research is inferring causal relations based on observed data. One commonly used approach involves utilizing structural causal models that postulate noisy functional relations among interacting variables. A directed graph naturally represents these models and reflects the underlying causal structure. However, classical identifiability results suggest that, without conducting additional experiments, this causal graph can only be identified up to a Markov equivalence class of indistinguishable models. Recent research has shown that focusing on linear relations with equal error variances can enable the identification of the causal structure from mere observational data. Nonetheless, practitioners are often primarily interested in the effects of specific interventions, rendering the complete identification of the causal structure unnecessary. In this work, we investigate the extent to which less restrictive assumptions of partial homoscedasticity are sufficient for identifying the causal effects of interest. Furthermore, we construct mathematically rigorous confidence regions for total causal effects under structure uncertainty and explore the performance gain of relying on stricter error assumptions in a simulation study.}

	abstract = {Staged trees are probabilistic graphical models capable of representing any class of non-symmetric independence via a coloring of their vertices. Several structural learning routines have been defined and implemented to learn staged trees from data, under the frequentist or Bayesian paradigm. They assume a data set has been observed fully and, in practice, observations with missing entries are either dropped or imputed before learning the model. Here, we introduce the first algorithms for staged trees that handle missingness within the learning of the model. To this end, we characterize the likelihood of staged tree models in the presence of missing data and discuss pseudo-likelihoods that approximate it.  A structural expectation-maximization algorithm estimating the model directly from the full likelihood is also implemented and evaluated. A computational experiment showcases the performance of the novel learning algorithms, demonstrating that it is feasible to account for different missingness patterns when learning staged trees.}

    abstract = {Causal discovery amounts to learning a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that encodes a causal model. This model selection problem can be challenging due to its large combinatorial search space, particularly when dealing with non-parametric causal models. Recent research has sought to bypass the combinatorial search by reformulating causal discovery as a continuous optimization problem, employing constraints that ensure the acyclicity of the graph. In non-parametric settings, existing approaches typically rely on finite-dimensional approximations of the relationships between nodes, resulting in a score-based continuous optimization problem with a smooth acyclicity constraint. In this work, we develop an alternative approximation method by utilizing reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and applying general sparsity-inducing regularization terms based on partial derivatives. Within this framework, we introduce an extended RKHS representer theorem. To enforce acyclicity, we advocate the log-determinant formulation of the acyclicity constraint and show its stability. Finally, we assess the performance of our proposed RKHS-DAGMA procedure through simulations and illustrative data analyses.}

queries, LearnSPN applies a hard method for learning them, propagating at each sum node
a data point through one and only one of the children/edges as in a hard clustering process.
We propose a new learning procedure named SoftLearn, that induces a PC using a soft
clustering process. We investigate the effect of this learning-inference compatibility in PCs.
Our experiments show that SoftLearn outperforms LearnSPN in many situations, yielding
better likelihoods and arguably better samples. We also analyze comparable tractable

Leveraging {Q}-conjugacy within a local message passing framework allows deriving analytic inference update equations for nonconjugate models. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on Bayesian Poisson regression and a model involving a hidden gamma-distributed latent variable with Gaussian-corrupted logarithmic observations.

abstract = {A frequent goal in healthcare is to estimate personalized causal effects in order to select the best treatment for a patient from observational or experimental (RCT) data (or both), where "best" is defined in terms of maximizing the expectation of the desired outcome. The first task in estimating personalized effects is selecting the optimal set of personalization covariates (causal feature selection). This set of covariates is the Markov Boundary of the outcome in the experimental distribution, also known as the Interventional Markov Boundary (IMB), and can be identified from RCT data using methods for finding Markov Boundaries. However, most RCT data are very limited in sample size and do not work well with these methods. In this work, we develop methods that combine limited experimental and large observational data to identify the IMB, and improve the estimation of conditional (personalized) causal effects. These methods extend recent results (Triantafillou et al., 2021), which were limited to discrete data, to mixed data with binary and ordinal outcomes. The methods are based on Bayesian regression models. In simulated data, we show that our methods identify the correct IMB and improve causal effect estimation.}

    abstract = {Structural causal models permit causal and counterfactual reasoning, and can be regarded as an extension of Bayesian networks. The model consists of endogenous and exogenous variables, with exogenous variables often being of unknown semantic interpretation. Consequently, they are typically non-observable, with the result that counterfactual queries may be unidentifiable. In this setting, standard inference algorithms for Bayesian networks are insufficient. Recent methods attempt to bound unidentifiable queries through imprecise estimation of exogenous probabilities. However, these approaches become unfeasible with growing cardinality of the exogenous variables. This paper proposes a divide and conquer method that transforms a general causal model into a set of models with low-cardinality exogenous variables, for which any query can be calculated exactly. Bounds for a query in the original model are then efficiently approximated by aggregating the results for the set of smaller models. Experimental results demonstrate that these bounds can be computed with lower error levels and less resource consumption compared to existing methods.}

The trade-off between the quality of discretization/inference and the computational cost of inference with decision diagrams is explored by contrasting both metrics on a Pareto front. Through empirical evaluation across a range of causal and non-causal Bayesian networks, we investigate the impact of different discretization methods on this trade-off. We corroborate the significantly improved scalability of using decision diagrams for inference as opposed to traditional inference methods and extend this finding to discretized continuous networks. Coupled with insights on the accuracy-compute cost trade-off, we advocate for discretization as a viable method for Bayesian network inference on continuous networks.}

abstract = {Bayesian networks (BNs) represent a probabilistic model that can visualize relationships between variables. We apply various BN structure learning algorithms to a large dataset from a Czech university entrance exam. This dataset includes a test of active, open-minded thinking designed by Jonathan Baron, as well as a test of students' attitudes toward various conspiracies. Using BNs, we were able to identify the structure of the conspiracies and their relationships with active open-minded thinking. We also compared results of different BN structure learning algorithms with results of selected standard data analysis methods.}

    pages = {486-497},
    abstract = {Bayesian network structure learning is an NP-hard problem. Furthermore, the problem remains hard even for various subclasses of graphs. Motivated by the hardness of exact learning, we study approximation algorithms for learning Bayesian networks. First, we propose a moderately exponential time algorithm with running time $\mathcal{O}(2^{\frac{\ell}{r}n})$ that has an approximation ratio $\frac{\ell}{r}$ where $n$ is the number of vertices and $\ell$ and $r$ are user-defined parameters with $\ell\leq r$. That is, we give time--approximation trade-offs for learning Bayesian networks. Second, we present a polynomial time algorithm with an approximation ratio $\frac{1}{d}$ to find an optimal graph whose connected components have size at most $d$. }

title = {Estimating Bounds on Causal Effects Considering Unmeasured Common Causes},
author = {Bejos, Sebastian and Sucar, Luis Enrique and Morales, Eduardo F.},
pages = {498-514},
abstract = {Maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) can represent causal relationships in systems that include unmeasured common direct causes. Constraint-based causal discovery methods are able to find solely the Markov Equivalence Class (MEC) of the causal structure given a set of observational data. To bound the total effect estimation between a pair of variables, when the MEC of the causal structure is known, the causal effect on each member in the MEC are computed, while keeping the minimum and maximum values as the lower and upper bounds for the total causal effect. However, when the modeling is done using MAGs, i.e., the MEC is encoded as a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG), it is not always possible to find an adjustment set over some pairs of variables for the computation of the causal effect by covariance adjustment. In such cases, the LV-IDA algorithm returns missing values on the causal effects computation for some, and occasionally all, of the MAGs in the PAG. We present an extension of the LV-IDA algorithm, which we call the LV-IDA+ algorithm, that can compute approximated bounds of causal effects between every pair of the variables on a PAG. To achieve this, we propose a way to approximate the causal effect estimations when it is not possible to find adjustment sets for some pairs of variables on the MAGs in a PAG. We evaluate the performance of LV-IDA+ using simulated data generated by a canonical DAGs and compare with the LV-IDA algorithm. The results suggest the approximations of causal effects computed by LV-IDA+, are better than the missing values (simple NAs) returned by the LV-IDA algorithm, at least for the case of observational data generated by a canonical DAGs with latent variables.}

    title = {Serving MPE Queries on Tensor Networks by Computing Derivatives},
    author = {Wenig, Maurice and Barschel, Hanno and Giesen, Joachim and Goral, Andreas and Blacher, Mark},
    pages = {515-527},
    abstract = {Recently, tensor networks have been proposed as a data structure for weighted model counting. Computing a weighted model count is thus reduced to contracting a factorized tensor expression. Inference queries on graphical models, especially PoE (probability of evidence) queries, can be expressed directly as weighted model counting problems. Maximization problems can also be addressed on the same data structure, only the standard sum-product semiring has to be replaced by either the tropical (max-sum) or the Viterbi (max-product) semiring in the computations, that is, the tensor contractions. However, tensor contractions only provide maximal values, but MPE (most probable explanation) queries on graphical models do not ask for the maximal value, but for a state, or even the states, at which the maximal value is attained. In the special case of tropical tensor networks for ground states of spin glasses, it has been observed that the ground state can be obtained by computing a derivative of the tensor network over the tropical semiring. Here, we generalize this observation, provide a generic algorithm for computing the derivatives, and prove its correctness.}

title = {Cauchy Graphical Models},
author = {Muvunza, Taurai and  Li, Yang and Ercan, Engin, Kuruoglu},
pages = {528-542},
abstract = {A common approach to learning Bayesian networks involves specifying an appropriately chosen family of parameterized probability density such as Gaussian. However, the distribution of most real-life data is leptokurtic and may not necessarily be best described by a Gaussian process. In this work we introduce Cauchy Graphical Models (CGM), a class of multivariate Cauchy densities that can be represented as directed acyclic graphs with arbitrary network topologies, the edges of which encode linear dependencies between random variables. We develop CGLearn, the resultant algorithm for learning the structure and Cauchy parameters based on Minimum Dispersion Criterion (MDC). Experiments using simulated datasets on benchmark network topologies demonstrate the efficacy of our approach when compared to Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM).}
